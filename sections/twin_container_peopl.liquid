That\u2019s when we knew we had to make a change! Inspired by the bold energy of the 70s, we\u2019ve created a range of products designed to make women feel proud, empowered, and in control of their menopause journey.<br\/><br\/>The name \u2018GLORIAH\u2019 draws inspiration from two icons: Gloria Steinem, a leader of second-wave feminism, and Gloria Gaynor, whose anthem \u201cI Will Survive\u201d became a symbol of female empowerment. The added \u2018H\u2019 symbolizes pleasure\u2014something we believe is central to women\u2019s health and well-being. Our product names follow suit: \u2018Liberation Oil\u2019 pays homage to theWomen\u2019s Liberation Movement, and \u2018Soul Gel\u2019 is a nod to Funk and Soul, which was deeply connected."},{"id":"image_image","type":"image_picker","label":"Image"}],"presets":[{"name":"Twin Container Peopl","category":"Liquify","blocks":[]}]} {% endschema %}
