That’s when we knew we had to make a change! Inspired by the bold energy of the 70s, we’ve created a range of products designed to make women feel proud, empowered, and in control of their menopause journey.The name ‘GLORIAH’ draws inspiration from two icons: Gloria Steinem, a leader of second-wave feminism, and Gloria Gaynor, whose anthem “I Will Survive” became a symbol of female empowerment. The added ‘H’ symbolizes pleasure—something we believe is central to women’s health and well-being. Our product names follow suit: ‘Liberation Oil’ pays homage to theWomen’s Liberation Movement, and ‘Soul Gel’ is a nod to Funk and Soul, which was deeply connected.",
